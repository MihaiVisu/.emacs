.emacs
======

.emacs settings file created for coding in haskell. This is my favorite settings behaviour in emacs when coding in Haskell.

If on Linux, preferably Ubuntu, just copy and replace this file with the one from ~/.emacs.

NOTE that this file is hidden, so press ctrl+H to view all the hidden files in your home directory.
